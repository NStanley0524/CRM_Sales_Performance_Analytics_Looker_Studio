# CRM Analytics Dashboard â€” Sales and Pipeline Performance

## Overview
This project presents a **CRM (Customer Relationship Management) analytics dashboard** built to evaluate how effectively a companyâ€™s sales process converts leads into paying customers.  
The analysis leverages **HubSpot CRM data** stored in **Google BigQuery** and visualized with **Looker Studio**.  

The dashboard provides executives, sales managers, and analysts with a clear view of **pipeline performance**, **revenue distribution**, and **data quality** across the companyâ€™s CRM system.

## Aim of the Project

The goal of this project is to analyze a companyâ€™s CRM data to uncover actionable insights into its sales performance and pipeline efficiency.
It aims to:

- Evaluate how effectively leads are converted into deals.

- Identify top-performing sales representatives and industries.

- Detect weak points in the sales funnel where deals often drop.

- Provide business leaders with a real-time view of revenue and performance.

Ultimately, the dashboard helps transform raw CRM data into strategic business intelligence for better decision-making.

## Business Context
The company, is a **B2B technology firm** that provides cloud-based software and automation tools to other organizations.  
Its business relies on generating leads (contacts) from various industries, nurturing them into opportunities (deals), and managing those relationships through its CRM system.

The data represents:
- **Companies**: Client organizations the business interacts with.  
- **Contacts**: Individuals (decision-makers) within those companies.  
- **Deals**: Sales opportunities or transactions pursued by the sales representatives.

By analyzing these datasets together, the company aims to understand:
- Which industries and clients bring the highest revenue.  
- How efficiently leads move through the sales funnel.  
- Which sales representatives perform best.  
- Where deals most often get stuck or lost.  
- How complete and reliable the CRM data is.

## Data Modelling and Transformation

Before visualization, the three datasets â€” companies, contacts, and deals â€” were transformed and queried in **Big Query**.

Using SQL scripts, the data was joined across tables (company_id as the key) to create a unified view.

This process created a single analytical dataset (crm_analysis_view) used in Looker Studio for reporting. [Here](crm_analytics_view.txt) is the sql script used.

## Project Objectives
1. Evaluate the **health of the sales pipeline** across six stages.  
2. Measure **conversion and win rates** to identify sales efficiency.  
3. Analyze **revenue distribution** by industry, company, and sales owner.  
4. Highlight **data quality gaps** (missing emails, job titles, etc.) in the CRM.  
5. Provide executives with actionable insights to improve sales performance and forecasting.
